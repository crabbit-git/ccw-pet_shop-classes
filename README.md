# What's this then?

It was given out toward the end of a taught (remote) lesson during a software development course to get us set up for the following day, at which point we were to go through the exercise as a code-along worked example to help improve our understanding of classes in Python. The files provided are inside `startpoint`.

Because I felt like I had a reasonably good understanding of classes and thought I might be able to figure it out for myself, I wanted to give it a bash rather than waiting to see how they solved it in the next lesson. I managed it fine. I'm curious to find out how my solution might differ from the one that's provided tomorrow!


# What does it do?

It's kind of an incomplete program, but it pertains to tracking a number of attributes related to the buying and selling of pets in a hypothetical pet shop: the pets themselves, their values, the cash balances of the shop and its customers, and so forth.

The task was essentially to make all the pre-written unit tests pass by writing code in modules residing in the `src` package. To check that the tests pass, you can run `run_tests.py` from a terminal. That's pretty much it.
